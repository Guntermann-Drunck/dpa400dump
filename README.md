# dpa400dump
A wireshark extcap for the Unigraf DPA400 DisplayPort AUX channel monitor

## Preparations for Linux usage

The DPA400 USB interface is a FTDI 232R with custom VID/PID.
So make sure you have the ftdi_sio kernel module installed. Then add an udev rule that handles the custom IDs.

Add a file like 99-usbftdi.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d with the following content:
```
ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16a6", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1000", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe ftdi_sio" RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 16a6 1000 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id'"
```
Maybe you have to force your system to update udev rules, but that is distro sepcific.

Then plugin your devivce. dmesg should show something like:
```

```
## Preparations for Windows usage

Under windows you can simply use the driver that is coming with the device. You just have to find out, which serial port (COMx) is used.

## Installation

Simply copy this file to your wireshark extcap directory (Help > About Wireshark > Folders) and make sure it is executable.
After restarting wireshark you should see a DPA400 capture interface.
